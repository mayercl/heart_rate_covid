In heart_rate_covid/data, the de-identified files with the parameters from the heart rate algorithm should be included. The Day column indicates the day relative to symptom onset. 

Scripts to run the heart rate algorithm can be found in heart_rate_covid. The bayes_hr_estimator_oneday.m file is the main function called when running these analyses. 

For additional information on the scripts and data, contact mayercl@umich.edu
